This is a quiz made for TRUE BAGEL LOVERS (like me).

The idea came from my love for bagels. When I was thinking what community I belong to before I start making the quiz, this idea pops up, why can't I make a my own bagel community? What if we had to prove our loyalty through slightly ridiculous questions?  What if we can have an official license when we passed the quiz? Thatâ€™s how this project started.

I also designed the layout and interactions to feel soft, warm and playful (like bagels):
Floating YES button on Q1 that runs away until you prove determination'
PNG bagels and spreads with transparent backgrounds so that they look more realistic like your're choosing them in a bakery.
A Bagel License styled like a real ID card at the end with cute bagal proflie photo as you if you were a bagel.

I chose pastel colors, soft borders, and a fun font to keep things feeling light and friendly.

Challenges:
I had to figure out how to use "localStorage" to pass info between pages. I split my JS files into one for general functions (quiz.js) and another for event/page-specific logic (storage.js).
It took me a while to figure out how to only display the "bagel" in a image. I removed all the background of the bagel pictures and export them as PNG.

If I have more time I would probably add sound effects, like a crunch sound or toaster ding sounds when choosing a bagel and generate the license. It would be fun if I can let users upload their own bagel pic for the license and download it as image. And I would add more fun questions
